This application provides various Natural Language Processing (NLP) functions through a Docker container. It includes features like n-gram repetition analysis, lexical diversity calculation, and more.

To use this app, follow these simple steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to this subdirectory.
4. Make the run.sh script executable by running the following command:
``` bash
chmod +x run.sh
```
5. Run the script:
``` bash
./run.sh
```

The script will build the image and start the container. You can then interact with it through the command line. We provided an input folder where you can store your files for analysis, but it is not required as the app takes in paths as arguments. The outputs are saved in the output folder.
